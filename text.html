        <p class="word"> Internet scams are more common than you think. There are many types of internet scams like: you just won a” something cool” press thins link and pay for shipping or the Nigerian prince that wants to give you diamonds and many more. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="word"> If you get scammed you might lose money, get in jail, lose your house, family or friends. This would be terrible on tis own but if you say talk about it online people will say that you are stupid for falling for a scam.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="word"> The” just won a” something cool” press thins link and pay for shipping” makes you enter your card information so that the scammer(s) can get your card info to use to buy stuff. The “Nigerian prince that wants to give you diamonds” is a well-known scam that makes you pay for shipping for “diamonds” the transaction usually is through some third-party app like PayPal, so it is harder to track down.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="word"> You can avoid being scammed online by not clicking on links people you don’t know sends you, realise that if something is to good to be true it probably is not true, do not click on ads, don’t answer the phone if you don’t know who is calling and the best way to not be scammed online is to not be online and to live in the woods. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="word"> You need to be more careful on the internet because internet scams are common on the internet and if you get scammed a lot of bad things are going to happened. </p>
